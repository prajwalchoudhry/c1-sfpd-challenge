# c1-sfpd-challenge
This is my entry for CapitalOne's 2018 Software Engineering Summer Summit Challenge. This challenge provided us with public data from the San Francisco Fire Department containing dispatch information for emergency calls, with call time, location, and dispatch. We were tasked with creating a web application which visualized the data and also determined which type of dispatch would be most likely needed given a time and place.
